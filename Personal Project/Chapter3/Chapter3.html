            <p>Hurricane was nervous. She was going to bootcamp today. One thing made her a bit less though. Centurion was going to be there. She started to fly of with a definitely not smile on her face. She spotted multiple wings of dragons flying towards what she assumed to be her destination.</p>

            <p>As she arrived, she noticed a lot of Skywings, a few Icewings, and a whole lot of tents flapping in the wind, however her eyes were looking for one certain dragon. Someone with warm blue eyes.</p>

            <p>She landed at the outskirts of the encampment, hearing shouts of orders being given. She cautiously wandered into the camp, still looking for that certain someone.</p>

            <p>"Hurricane?" A friendly voice asked.</p>

            <p>"Centi? Is that you?" Hurricane responded, unable to see the source of the voice.</p>

            <p>"Maybe."</p>

            <p>A smile crossed her face, finally, someone she knew and felt comfortable with.</p>

            <p>Centurion walked into her view, greeting her with a hug. She returned the embrace.</p>

            <p>"Hi Centi. Very nice seeing you again, I don't have anyone else to talk to really."</p>

            <p>"Maybe that will change here, but I am always going to be someone you can talk to. My plans on that aren't changing anytime soon." He said.</p>

            <p>"Sounds great. So, when is this thing getting started?"</p>

            <p>"Oh, it's already been going. You can just join in whenever, it's kind of like a open house."</p>

            <p>"Okay. You want to come with? Or did you already get started or something."</p>

            <p>"I have some experience, but I'll go with you anyway."</p>

            <p>"Thanks Centi."</p>

            <p>They ended up going around, looking for whatever. There were instructors giving talon to talon combat training, there were others giving flight tips, how to stay in formation, fire usage, and others also showing armor, spears, swords, and other weapons and gear.</p>

            <p>It was beautiful, in a way.</p>
