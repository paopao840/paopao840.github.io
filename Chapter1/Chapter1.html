            <p>Hurricane thought she was going to live a normal life with her mother and sister. The world had said no. She was stuck in here. She started weeping, thinking back to that oh so fateful night.</p>

            <p>*****</p>

            <p>A few weeks ago...</p>

            <p>Hurricane was sleeping. After a fun day of playing with her sister and the less fun day of learning, she had retired to her bed around the time dusk had settled. She was awoken by a loud noise coming from the front of the cave.</p>

            <p>"Cy? Are you there? What do you think is happening?" She asked.</p>

            <p>No response.</p>
        
            <p>"Cy?" She asked, a bit more worriedly.</p>

            <p>The sound of a roar was heard, then a breath of fire illuminated part of the cave, then the sound of metal colliding with stone. Hurricane glanced over at the spot her sister slept. Nothing. She tried to quietly creep towards the entrance of their sleeping cave.</p>

            <p>More fire illuminated her cave, making her flinch from the brightness. She smelled the iron filled scent of blood. She peeked out, hoping for something that would prove her worries wrong. She saw a flash of yellow and red, before quickly hiding from sight again.</p>

            <p>"GET AWAY FROM MY DAUGHTER!" She heard a voice roar. That was her mother. More fire sent heat all over her scales, and more growls and hisses as well.</p>

            <p>Then the sound of something heavy hitting the ground followed with a thud, and so did the awful sound of scales and flesh being cut.</p>
        
            <p>"They didn't mention dragonets." One voice said. "That is not something that I hoped to kill tonight."</p>

            <p>"It is unfortunate, but we are getting paid either way. Bring something to confirm the kills." A different voice responded. "They might pay extra because of the dragonet."</p>

            <p>"What about Boa?" The first voice questioned.</p>

            <p>"You can grab him if you want, he's dead anyways." The second one hissed. "I'll just be bringing proof."</p>

            <p>"Did you check for any more?" The first one asked. "They could have been sleeping."</p>

            <p>"No, but her husband is dead anyway, how would she have another dragonet?" The second answered. "Plus, we were loud."</p>

            <p>"Alright. Let's get out of here, you're right, we weren't quiet."</p>

            <p>A shuffle was heard. Something started getting dragged then a grunt as it was lifted. A slicing sound, then talonsteps and wingbeats. They slowly started getting quieter, until they were gone.</p>

            <p>Hurricane slowly walked into the main cave, taking it in. At the sight, she dashed to the side of her unmoving mother and sibling. There was also blood all over the floor.</p>

            <p>"Mom? Cy? Hello? Please...." Hurricane begged, shaking the unmoving forms. "Please, please wake up. Please don't leave me...."</p>

            <p>She began to cry. No one really knew them, and no one lived nearby either, so it was just Hurricane and the bodies of her mother and sister. She cried herself to sleep that night.</p>

            <p>*****</p>

            <p>Hurricane woke up, hoping and begging that what she had lived through was a dream. Judging from the completely still bodies of her mother and sister in front of her, it was not. She started crying again.</p>

            <p>After recovering from her sobbing, she tried to will herself into doing something. She still had to eat. Her mother had taught her to hunt for a reason.</p>

            <p>She took a deep breath, promising to herself to return, and left. She was looking something to eat. As she flew, she took in the trees and mountains that made up the valley that surrounded her home. She remembered the memories of playing with her sister and spending time with her mother here. She realized she couldn't make any more, bringing her on the verge of tears yet again.</p>

            <p>Something distracted her from her thoughts. A flash of white at the edge of her vision had caught her eye. Looking over at it, she saw a lone mountain goat climbing one of the mountains. Remembering her lessons, she angled away from the sun so her shadow wouldn't give her away, and flew closer, careful not to make any loud noise. When she got close enough to it, she quickly dove down. As she neared it and the side of the mountain, she reached her talons out, flaring her wings and snatching the goat, the force of her dive killing it instantly.</p>

            <p>She finally had something to eat. Flying to a nearby ledge, she dropped the carcass and landed with a thump. She realized she had a problem. She didn't know how to cook it. She sighed and figured she would just eat it raw, especially since she was still very hungry.</p>

            <p>She started to eat the goat. As she ate, she thought about what she was going to do next. Maybe look for a village? She thought to herself. She felt like she needed to do something, that's what her family would have wanted, not just mourning for them forever, even if that's what she wanted to do.</p>

            <p>After she finished eating the goat, Hurricane wanted to find a Skywing settlement, to hopefully find something to keep her distracted, maybe like a job or something, as she was pretty sure the assassins took all the gold that her mother had.</p>

            <p>She took off from the ledge she rested on, and started looking for any nearby settlement. Flying through the valley, she realized she hadn't even seen another dragon since those Sandwings.</p>

            <p>After some time flying, she spotted something red. She hoped it was a dragon and not a bird or something, as they could be flying towards a village, hopefully.</p>

            <p>Nearing it, it became clear that it was a dragon. Their wings flapping in the calm breeze blowing through the valley. Hurricane started to follow the dragon, hoping to not get noticed as she did not want confrontation right now.</p>

            <p>A few minutes later, she noticed structures in the distance as the dragon picked up speed. She didn't bother to do the same, as she already spotted what they were flying towards. She saw many red and orange dragons flying about, and she hoped that what she was looking for was here.</p>
