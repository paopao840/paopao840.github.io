            <p>As Hurricane landed near the bustling town, she thought a bit more about her family. How her sister would never be able to experience what she would, and how her mother wouldn't be able to watch her grow. She also remembered that the assassins had said her father was dead, meaning that she really was the only member of her family left.</p>

            <p>She also wondered why they went after her mother. Did she do something wrong? Was she part of an important family? Maybe her father was important? She probably wouldn't figure it out, not for a while, at least.</p>

            <p>She started to look around the town, and something in the center caught her eye. A army recruitment stand. Something to distract her, and something she could do to get revenge, if she wanted to.</p>

            <p>As she moved towards the recruiter, they noticed noticed her. Turning to face her, she started to speak.</p>

            <p>"Hello! Are you looking to join the army?"</p>

            <p>"Umm." Hurricane started. "I think so."</p>

            <p>"Alright!" She responded. "I have a few questions for you. Before you go to training, hopefully."</p>

            <p>"Ask away."</p>

            <p>"Okay! First of all, do you have any form of fighting training or experience?"</p>

            <p>"Nope."</p>

            <p>"That is perfectly fine! You're going to training, after all. Secondly, do you have a certain role preference? A healer, cook, maybe a commander?"</p>

            <p>"I think I would prefer not being in the heat of battle, but I can probably work with whatever is available."</p>

            <p>"Alright! Also, almost forgot this one, how old are you? Can't let dragonets into the army, of course."</p>

            <p>"I'm 7 years old. Is that old enough? I'm technically an adult, to be fair."</p>

            <p>"That you are. Well, that's all the questions I have. Here, I'll find the map to the camp for you. Training starts next moon, and if I'm remembering correctly, that's in just a few more days." She said, before turning to search a few containers beside her. "Found it!" She exclaimed, handing a scroll to Hurricane.</p>

            <p>Hurricane gingerly took the scroll from the recruiter's talons, thanking them. "I'll be there, hopefully. Thank you!"</p>

            <p>"No problem!" She responded. "And thank you for fighting for our tribe and future."</p>

            <p>Hurricane smiled at her, and while waving goodbye she started walking away to explore the town.</p>

            <p>She walked down the town's main path, observing what dragons were doing nearby and a few different structures. There was a beautiful flourishing garden with a family exploring, the parents talking to their children, explaining what they were looking at. There was a blacksmith, radiating heat onto her scales with a dragon hammering away on something metal on an anvil.

            <p>Hurricane was so entranced with her surroundings that she didn't notice the dragons in front of her, until she accidentally walked into them.

            <p>"Oh my moons! I'm so sorry, I was distracted by something." She said.

            <p>A angry looking red-orange one started, "Watch your step next time, you-"

            <p>"Hey, she already said sorry, and I'm pretty sure she gets what your trying to say, no need to go too far." A red one interrupted. The red one had blue eyes. Odd, she had never seen that before on a Skywing.</p>

            <p>Hurricane stared awkwardly for a bit, before starting to back away. "Very sorry, I will stop bothering you guys now."</p>

            <p>The red-orange one turned back to his friend and restarted their conversation, "So did you hear about that pro-"</p>

            <p>She turned and walked the other direction before hearing anything else. She noticed a group of dragons crowding around what seemed to be a notice board, murmuring to each other.</p>

            <p>"A prophecy?"</p>

            <p>"Maybe this will end the war, like that Sandwing Succession one a couple hundred years ago."</p>

            <p>"I hope so, I've lost so many already..." Someone said sadly.</p>

            <p>Hurricane walked up and started moving through the group, eyeing the papers on the notice board. One stood out. Text written in white, with a very dark background, catching her eye like the rest of the dragons here. On it there was,</p>

            <p><i><b>As the war rages on</i></b></p>

            <p><i><b>Dragons will come</i></b></p>

            <p><i><b>Two of Sky, one of Ice and one of Sea</i></b></p>

            <p><i><b>While soldiers cry and roar</i></b></p>

            <p><i><b>While Queens fight and scheme</i></b></p>

            <p><i><b>While tribes cannot see eye to eye</i></b></p>

            <p><i><b>They will find the truth</i></b></p>

            <p><i><b>And from the grasp of war</i></b></p>

            <p><i><b>They will set Pyrhhia free</i></b></p>

            <p>...</p>

            <p>Ominous. Sounds like a prophecy. Since she didn't think it would affect her much, so she decided to keep going with her day.</p>

            <p>She also didn't know what to do. Hunting maybe? Try and find someone to chat with? She didn't know what else happened here that she could do. Go back to her home? She started getting lost in thought about her family again.</p>

            <p>"Hi again." A voice she heard earlier said, surprising her back into reality.</p>

            <p>Hurricane turned around, spotting one of the dragons from that group she had ran into earlier. The blue eyed one.</p>

            <p>"Just wanted to apologize for the way my friend acted earlier. He may have drank a bit too much." He said.</p>

            <p>"Oh, no worries. I was the one that bumped into you guys anyways." She apologized.</p>

            <p>"Oh, my name is Centurion by the way, and if you don't mind me asking, what's yours? I haven't seen you here before."</p>

            <p>"I just came by yesterday, so that's probably why. I'm Hurricane. Nice to meet you, Centurion."</p>

            <p>They ended up getting caught in conversation for a while, talking about life, work, family, but Hurricane felt like it wasn't the right time to bring up her recent drama about that.</p>

            <p>"Oh wow, it's late?" He murmured. "Very sorry Hurricane, but I have to get going now."</p>

            <p>She didn't even realize it got late already. She was so distracted by their talk that she forgot about anything else that was going on.</p>

            <p>"I didn't even realize. Thank you for getting my mind of things though, I have a lot going on right now. Have a goodnight Centi." She said, grinning.</p>

            <p>"Ha, a nickname already? Better than what my other friends call me, I guess." He said, with a smile.</p>

            <p>"What do they call you?" She asked, curiously.</p>

            <p>"That's for me to know, and for you to find out." He laughed.</p>

            <p>"Oh come on, please?"</p>

            <p>"Nope. Maybe another time. Seriously though, I need to get going."</p>

            <p>"Alright. Goodnight." </p>

            <p>"Night. How about we meet tomorrow? This was a great time."</p>

            <p>"Sure."</p>

            <p>Centurion waved a goodbye, and sprinted away, very much in a hurry. Hurricane smiled, and started walking away, thinking about how that distracted her from her other distresses, and definitely not about him.</p>
