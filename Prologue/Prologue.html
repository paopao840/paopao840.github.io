            <h1> ---------------------------------------------------- </h1>

            <h2>5470 AS</h2>
        
            <p>That was the prophecy that ended the War of Sandwing Succession, almost 500 years ago.</p>
        
            <p>A new one has been brewing. The fragile peace that has lasted the continent a few hundred years is ending, and has been for the past few decades. Border clashes and territorial disputes have been starting back up, and that have been mounting casualties.</p>
        
            <p>In glacial palace of Queen Icebreaker, the Queen is in a meeting with her highest ranking general, General Snowstorm.</p>
        
            <p>"Your majesty," Snowstorm started. "There has been another border incident with the Sandwings."</p>
        
            <p>"Another? This is going too far. Did we suffer any casualties?" She questioned. "I feel like there was another one too, recently."</p> 
        
            <p>"3 critically wounded, with over a dozen with more minor wounds." The general responded, gritting his teeth. "This is the second attack this month. I believe things are going to escalate. We have to respond. Our dragons deserve better than this, getting wounded and dying for no good reason."</p> 
        
            <p>"I am going to send a messenger to Queen Mirage." Icebreaker explained. "If we cannot come to an agreement, I also think we need to retaliate, somehow."</p> 
        
            <p>"I agree." He replied. "However, I think Mirage will not be convinced easily. I will brief the other generals, and prepare a plan of action, shall negotiations fail. I believe they will. Do not get your hopes up, Icebreaker."</p> 
        
            <p>"Okay. You are dismissed." She replied. "I will need some time to think about this."</p> 
        
            <p>"Alright. Thank you, your majesty. I wish you good luck." He said, before leaving the room.</p> 
        
            <p>A while later, while Icebreaker was deep in thought, a knock echoed from the door.</p>
        
            <p>"Mother?" A muffled voice asked.</p> 
            
            <p>"Yes, Polar? You may enter."</p> 
        
            <p>Princess Polar entered the room and stood beside her mother. "Are you thinking about something?" Polar asked. "You look distracted."</p>
        
            <p>"I am." Icebreaker replied. "There have been some recent things happening between us and the Sandwings at our border. Dragons have been dying."</p> 
        
            <p>"Oh. I feel like Mirage is the type to not care about anyone but her own tribe. What are you going to do?" Polar asked.</p> 
        
            <p>"I do not know. You and Snowstorm are correct, and Mirage does not budge easily." Icebreaker explained. "I'm going to send a message to her, but I think I may be escalating this too far."</p> 
        
            <p>"I believe you are doing the right thing here, Mother. The dragons that died deserve fair a response against the dragons that hurt them."</p> 
        
            <p>"Alright. Thank you dear, I will send her an message. I hope she responds well, or we might be going to war." Icebreaker began to write.</p> 
        
            <p>Mirage, you need to end these attacks. Dragons are dying here. I will retaliate unless you do something about this matter at hand. This requires a quick response, before I do something. My dragons are getting hurt. They want something, and it is looking to be blood.</p> 
        
            <p>Icebreaker went to look for a messenger. She walking around her palace, admiring the art of the ice that formed it created. She was contemplating her message when she bumped into Blizzard, Snowstorm's son.</p> 
        
            <p>"Hello Blizzard, do you know what is happening with the Sandwings?" Icebreaker started. "I need to send their Queen a message."</p> 
        
            <p>"I think I heard him rambling about something concerning them earlier, but I don't know exactly what is going on. Why?" He asked.</p> 
        
            <p>"There have been a few border attacks recently, and I want to send Mirage a message so we can figure it out, preferably peacefully." She responded. "Also, I need someone to bring her a message. Do you think you could deliver it for me?"</p> 
        
            <p>"Of course, your majesty." He said. "I think you have probably already heard this as I overheard you speaking to my father earlier, but I doubt Mirage will care about this."</p> 
        
            <p>"I did, and I agree, but I think it would be a good idea to send this anyway. Even if just to try to solve it without bloodshed."</p> 
        
            <p>"Noble intentions, your majesty. I will try to bring this to Queen Mirage.</p> 
        
            <p>"Thank you, Blizzard. I wish you good luck."</p> 
        
            <p>She started making her way back to her chambers, and heard the talonsteps of Blizzard walking the opposite direction.</p> 
        
            <h1> ---------------------------------------------------- </h1>
        
            <p>Queen Icebreaker was busying herself with work to try and distract herself from the worries nagging at the back of her mind. She has had a headache for the past few hours thinking about the situation with the Sandwings.</p>
        
            <p>She was taken from her thoughts as increasingly louder talonsteps were heard.</p>
        
            <p>"Your majesty, they- the Sandwings, they don't care." He growled. "They told me to get out, and that it is not their problem."</p>
        
            <p>"What? Why!?" She asked. "Their dragons are dying as well, and this situation can very easily devolve into a much larger conflict!"</p>
        
            <p>"I know! That's what I was trying to explain, but they just wouldn't listen." He hissed. "They were mocking me! The disrespect to the dead!"</p>
        
            <p>"I hoped it would not come to this, but what almost everyone feared might happen. I can not let our dragons keep paying for the mistakes Mirage is making." She explained.</p>
        
            <p>Icebreaker sighed.</p>
        
            <p>"Will you have to do what I think?"</p>
        
            <p>"Yes." Icebreaker paused.</p>
